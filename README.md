# Rich Vocabulary
Enrich your english vocabulary inside a console application

Type `find/practice <word>` to see the  definition of the word. Choose if you want to save it for practice or not.
After you saved a lot of words, type `practice`. you will be given a set of question to test how much you know the words.

Type `remove <word>` to remove the word from the saved words
Type `exit` to exit the program.


Each saved word has a score to determine how well the user knows it. the score adjusts automatically and when practicing the algorithm will use words with high practice priority when practicing.

ngl the code is pretty bad :)
